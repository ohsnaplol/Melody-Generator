# Melody-Generator
## Can't think of a tune? Let the computer do it for you!

This program randomizes a set of music notes with a given key signature and plays it back for you using the JFugue API.
Worked on this in a group in one of my classes and it was a great experience! Bit buggy here and there but considering doing a re-write with a different API.
